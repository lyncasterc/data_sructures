- Queue: 
    - works on FIFO, first in first out.
    
    - two ends, front and rear
    
    - insertion happens at the rear
     [1,2,3, ] <- insert here, pushing
    
    - deletion happens at front (1 was first to enter, 1 is first to come out), shifting
     delete from here  -> [2,3, ]

    - ADT: 
        - space
        - front pointer
        - rear pointer

        - operations:
            - enqueue(x) -> insertion at rear, push
            - dequeue() -> deletion at front, shifting
            - is_empty()
            - is_full()
            - first()
            - last()

        - can be implemented with arrays or linked lists.

        - array with rear pointer:
            - rear starts at -1
            - insertions takes constant O(1)
            - deletions take O(n) because all elements need to be shifted backwards

        - array with front and rear pointer:
            - front and rear start at -1

            - insertions takes constant O(1). rear moves forward by 1 each time

            - deletions take O(1). instead of shifting elements backwards, just move front pointer forward and delete.

            - rear points on last element, front points before first element

            - when front == rear, Queue is empty

            - when rear == size - 1, queue is full
