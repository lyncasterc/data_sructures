- Queue: 
    - works on FIFO, first in first out.
    
    - two ends, front and rear
    
    - insertion happens at the rear
     [1,2,3, ] <- insert here, pushing
    
    - deletion happens at front (1 was first to enter, 1 is first to come out), shifting
     delete from here  -> [2,3, ]

    - ADT: 
        - space
        - front pointer
        - rear pointer

        - operations:
            - enqueue(x) -> insertion at rear, push
            - dequeue() -> deletion at front, shifting
            - is_empty()
            - is_full()
            - first()
            - last()

        - can be implemented with arrays or linked lists.

        - array with rear pointer:
            - rear starts at -1
            - insertions takes constant O(1)
            - deletions take O(n) because all elements need to be shifted backwards

        - array with front and rear pointer:
            - front and rear start at -1

            - insertions takes constant O(1). rear moves forward by 1 each time

            - deletions take O(1). instead of shifting elements backwards, just move front pointer forward and delete.

            - rear points on last element, front points before first element

            - when front == rear, Queue is empty

            - when rear == size - 1, queue is full

            - drawbacks:
                - when rear is at size - 1 and there is only one element in the queue, you can't insert more even if the queue is nearly empty (meaning every location can only be used once)

                - when queue is empty, you can't insert because rear is size - 1. when its empty, it's also "full"

                - solution: reset pointers back to -1. 
                    - still doesnt guarantee spaces will be used

                - solution: circular queue
                    - when rear is size -1, and front is not 0, you can set rear to 0 and insert

            - linked list:
                - empty when front is null
                - no limit, so full when new node can not be created (heap is full)
                - inserting when front is null:
                    make front = new node and point rear on front.

- Double ended queue (array):
    - front and rear can both be used for inserting or deleting.
    
    - inserting from rear: same as before. pre-increment and insert
    - deleting from rear: post-decrement and set null;
    - deleting from front: normal method (with wrap around)
    - inserting from front: insert at front and go backwards. cant insert when first is -1.

    - input restricted doubled ended queue:
        - can not insert from front, but can delete
        - can insert and delete from rear
    
    - output restricted doubled ended queue:
        - can insert and delete from front
        - can insert from rear, but not delete
