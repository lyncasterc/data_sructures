Stack:
    - collection of elements following LIFO (last in, first out).
    -ex: 6-5-4-3-2-1 
        - 6 was inserted last, but will be first to come out.
    
    - can be visualized as being vertical, like a stack of books.
    
    - stack as an ADT:
        - space for storing elements
        - pointer for top most elements

        - operations:
            - pop(val)
            - push()
            - peek(index) ->looking at value
            - stack_top() -> looking at top value
            - is_empty
            - is_full
    
- Implementation:
    - array:
        - need fixed size array
        - size of array 
        - pointer to recently inserted element
        
        0   1   2  3  4 
        [10, 15, 7,  ,  ] <-- insert this side
                 ^top

        - when stack is empty, top pointer is -1
        
        - when full, top pointer is size - 1
