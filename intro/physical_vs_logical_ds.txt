-- Physical Data Structure:
    - Hold the actual data

    - Array:
        A = {8, 3, 4, 5, 6} 
             0  1  2  3  4  
        - fixed size 
        - can be created in stack or heap
    
    - Linked List:
        8 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> null   
        ^ - head       ^ - tail
        
        - collection of nodes that have data and links to the next node.

        - length of list can increase or reduce dynamically. 

        - created in heap

-- Logical Data Structure:
    - Stack  (linear, LIFO)
    - Queue  (linear, FIFO)
    - Trees  (non-linear)
    - Graph  (non-linear)
    - Hash tables (tabular)

    -performs operation on data(searching, insertion, deletion, etc)
