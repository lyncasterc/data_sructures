-- Time Complexity:
    - the time it takes for a computer to perform  a task.

    - depends on the procedure being used

    - example:
        - an array/list can have n elements.

        - time complexity for adding all elements or searching depends on how many elements there are, so it takes n or order of n. O(n). 

        - time complexity for looping through array, and comparing each element with all the other elemets in array is O(n^2). You'd be looping through array, and then having a nested inner loop going through the array.

        - time complexity for dividing array continously in half is log(n) (base 2).
            - for(i = n; i>1; i /= 2) n =  length of list
            {
                ...
            }
            
            - i = n;
              while(i >1)
              {
                  ...
                  i /= 2;
              }
        - matrix: O(n)

        - array of linked lists: O(m+n)

        - Tree: O(log n)

-- Space Complexity:
    - how much space is consumed in main memory during executin of program.

-- Recurrence Relation:
    - void func1(int n)  // T(n) --> time complexity
    {
        if(n > 0)         // 1 time unit
        {
            cout << n; // 1 time unit

            func1(n-1) // T(n-1)
        }
    }

    - sum of time is: T(n) = T(n-1) + 2 when n > 0. 
        - when n = 0, the func1 breaks and it takes one time unit to check that if statement
