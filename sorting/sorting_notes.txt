Critera for sorting:
    - Number of comparisions -> decides the time complexity
    - Number of swaps
    - adaptive 
        - if the list is already sorted, then it is O(n)
    - stable: perserves the relative order of equal (duplicate) elements
    
- Comparison based sorting:
    - O(n^2):
        - Bubble sort
        - Selection sort
        - Insertion sort
    
    - O(n log n):
        - Merge sort
        - Heap sort
        - Quick sort
        - tree sort
    
    - O(n):
        - Counting sort
        - Radix sort
        - Bucket/bin sort
    
    - O(n^3/2):
        - shell sort
