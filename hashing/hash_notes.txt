- Analysis of hashes are based on loading factor.
 - loading factor = n/size -> written as lambda
 - lambda is the number of items in the linked list 



Chaining:
    - h(x) = x % 10 -> this isnt the only function you can use 
    - each element in hash table is a linked list
    - if there is a collision, the linked list will be extended
    - avg succesful search is 1 + lambda/2
    - unsuccessfull search is 1 + lambda

    - Problem: with h(x) = x % 10
        - if all the numbers end in the same digiit, they will be inserted at the same key
        - this would mean that the lamba assertion fails 
        - to choose proper hash function, we need an idea of the keys we are working with
